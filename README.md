Python Program to View and Zoom Different Fractals

Use main for viewing and zooming customizable functions. 
The Newton type generator, and create fractals from any function with more then 3 roots, that can be found with newtons method.
The Stability type fractal, finds stability of a 2 d function in the plane of input values. Mandlebrot set would be an example of stability fractals.
